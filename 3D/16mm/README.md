# 16mm Feeders are in Beta!

Feel free to try them out. The 16mm design has been working great, but needs more long term testing before they are out of beta. 

## Parts

The 16mm Max Feeders use exactly the same hardware as the 8mm kit which you can buy here:

## Setup

Follow the same instructions as the 8mm assembly and Open PnP configuration, however instead of feeding 4mm in Open PnP you'll want to feed 8mm.
