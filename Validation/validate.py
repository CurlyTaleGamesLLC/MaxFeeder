# this script is for testing a 0816 style feeders
#  
# It requires Open PNP to be open and the camera settings to be adjusted
# so that the tape is white and the tape holes for the parts are below the threshold (black)
# 
# For more accurate measurements increase the size of the camera view in Open PNP
#
# download and install autohotkey and open the "Window Spy" application, you can use
# Window Spy to measure the pixel position on the screen, as well as the pixel color
# for the threshold

# adjust the screenshot region to be around the part you are measuring drift on
# measure distance in pixels between 4mm sprocket holes, mine was 65.8 pixels / mm
