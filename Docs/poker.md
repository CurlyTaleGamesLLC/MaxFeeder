# Max Feeder Servo Poker Assembly

You will need the following components to assemble the Servo Poker

- MG90S Servo
- MG90S Servo Horn
- MG90S Servo Screws
- Poker 3D print
- Poker Arm 3D print
- M3 6mm machine screw
- 2mm Smooth Rod - cut to 13mm in length
- Twist Tie

Note: the kits have been upgraded to use MG90S servos, however the documentation currently still shows SG90 servos. SG90 servos work reliably for 8mm and 12mm max feeders.

## Instructions

Locate the servo horn and depending on the size of the servo horn cut it at either the 2nd or 3rd hole. It should be roughly 6mm from center of the servo screw and the center of the hole you will attach the poker arm to. See above photo.

Wrap the servo cable back and forth and use a twist tie to hold it in place.

## Poker Tip

### PCB Tips

For new builds, snap off a tiny 0.8mm poker tip PCB, and push it onto the poker. The 3D print has a small clip that should hold it in place. Use some Super Glue (CA glue) to secure the PCB to the 3D print. 

If you didn't buy the kit and have some scrap 0.8mm PCBs lying around you can cut them into tiny triangles and glue those in place.

### Legacy Plastic Tip

Skip this step if you are using the new PCB poker tips (highly recommended).

**Using a fresh blade on a box knife cut the tip of the poker. It's very important to keep the tip of the poker nice and pointy. That point will ratchet over the sprocket holes in the tape when the arm pulls back, and then it will catch in the holes when it moves forward.**

If it's too blunt or if you cut too much off it won't catch the sprocket holes on the 8mm SMD part tape. Don't try to cut it it with a dull blade, you won't get a sharp point and will regret it later.

## Adding Guide Pin

Using some pliers push the 2mm smooth rod into the poker arm. It is a very tight fit and you will have to work the pliers back and forth to get the rod through. Make sure the rod is centered so the tips that are poking out are even on both sides.

Take a M3 6mm screw and screw it all the way through the hole on the poker.

![](poker/015_poker_arm_dot.jpg)
The poker arm 3D print has two holes. There is a small dot to the right of the small hole. Orient the parts as shown and screw the M6 6mm screw into the larger hole on the poker arm.

![](poker/016_move.jpg)
![](poker/017_move.jpg)
The screw should be tight but the poker and poker arm should be able to pivot on the M3 6mm screw.

![](poker/018_servo_screw.jpg)
![](poker/019_servo_screw2.jpg)
Take one of the servo horn screws and screw it into small hole on the poker arm. The hole is tight to prevent slop when the servo advances the tape later, however you still want the 3D print to rotate freely. Widen the hole slightly by screwing and unscrewing the servo horn screw in the 3D print.

Attach the poker arm to the servo horn using the servo horn screw. Screw into the last hole on the cut servo horn.
