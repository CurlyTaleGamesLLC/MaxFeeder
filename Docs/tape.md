To load tape insert the tape in front of the spring screw on the bottom. You can double click the tape lever to actuate the servo to help feed the tape through.

If you find the servo is pusing the tape backwards tighten down the screw on the top of the Max Feeder to add a little more friction so the servo can ratchet the poker arm back without moving the tape.

Once some of the tape is poking out of the front of the feeder you can pull it through manually.

Peel the cover tape back and thread it through the hole in the tape lever. Then push the tape into the spinning gears of the tape motor. When the gears catch the tape it will pull the lever down pressing the switch on the feeder causing it to turn the motor off.

When the feeder actuates the tape will have some slack which will cause the lever to lift up and turn the motor back on which will then pull the slack below until it causes the lever to be pulled down again and turn off the motor again.

There is a small slot on the front of the poker arm. If you stick a small flat head screw driver, or some tweezers into that slot and pry it up the poker arm will no longer touch the sprocket holes on the tape allowing you to pull the tape out of the feeder.
